# Stonks
Simulated Stocks System
Set 5 stocks with 4 variables that can be changed in the code. 
You can add or remove stocks with the stonkList.
There are also AI Consumers that will buy and sell stocks that will change the outcome. 
The Consumers are run on a probability system. A random number will be chosen, but the bounds of the number will be determined by prices of the stock.
You can change the amount of consumers with the variable consumerAmount. Currently set at 500.
You can save and load previous saves and continue playing even after the program has stopped.
